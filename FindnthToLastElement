/**
Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list

Thinking process:
1. Find nth node in normal order.
2. Have a head at index0.
3. Move both head and nth node. WHen nth node hit null/end, then the moving head is the nth to last node in list.

public Node find_nth_to_last( Node head, int n )
{
    Node point1 = head;
    for( int i = 0; i < n; i++ )
    {
        point1 = point1.next;
    }
    Node point2 = head;
    while( point1.next != null )
    {
        point1 = point1.next;
        point2 = point2.next;
